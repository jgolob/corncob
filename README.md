# CORNCOB: Beta-binomial regression of count data

## Introduction
This is a python implementation of the [R corncob package](https://github.com/bryandmartin/corncob).
This is a beta-binomal model-based approach for hypothesis testing of count data such as that generated by microbiome 16S rRNA or RNAseq experiments.

The method was first developed by [Dr. Willis](http://statisticaldiversitylab.com/team) and her (then) mentee Dr. Martin, and is fully described in [Modeling microbial abundances and dysbiosis with beta-binomial regression](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1587002666).
